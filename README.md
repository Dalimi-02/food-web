Creating a food website using HTML and CSS is a great project to showcase your web development skills
Here's a brief description of how you can go about building the website and using Git to manage your project:

1. Project Description:
Create a responsive food website that displays various food items, their details, and allows users to explore different categories of food. The website will have a clean and visually appealing design, making use of HTML for structuring the content and CSS for styling.

2. Project Setup:

Set up a new directory on your computer for the project.
Create the following files in the project directory:
index.html (main HTML file)
styles.css (CSS file for styling)
images directory (for storing food images)
3. HTML Structure:
In your index.html file, structure the website using HTML elements. Create sections for the header, featured food items, food categories, and footer.
. CSS Styling:
In your styles.css file, apply styles to different HTML elements to achieve the desired look for your food website. Use CSS properties like font-family, color, background, padding, and margin to style the layout and appearance.

5. Adding Content:
Populate your website with content. Add images of various food items to the images directory. Use HTML tags like <img>, <h1>, <p>, and lists (<ul>, <li>) to display food information.

6. Responsive Design:
Use media queries in your CSS to ensure that your food website looks good on different screen sizes, from desktop to mobile.
